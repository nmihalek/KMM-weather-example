# KMM-weather-example

Simple weather app for Android and iOS demonstrating KMM and it's benefits.

Built using clean architecture, which helps put business logic into a single module (shared) and thus promote code reusability between different platforms.

Accompanied by a presentation, which can be found [here](https://github.com/nmihalek/KMM-weather-example/raw/main/KMM%2C%20An%20overview%20-%20Nikola%20Mihalek.pdf).
